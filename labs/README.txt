Lab 1

It took me approximately 2 hours to complete this lab. 
To the best of my knowledge, the lab has been completed correctly. 

I took extensive help from the following link:

http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Getting_started_with_Ruby

The file mycouch.rb that I have pushed, has been written using 
the sample code provided on the webpage above. I have only made
small modifications to the code that I copied. The code that I found 
on this website had very useful documentation on error handling 
and basic commands such as making a database, document etc.
