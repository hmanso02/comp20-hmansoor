Assignment 3

To the best of my knowledge, everything has been correctly implemented
as specified. All the stations with a distinct icon and a connecting 
polyline are rendered on the map. The user's location is also displayed 
using a the default marker. Clicking on the self marker creates an info
window with the name of the station closest to you and your distance 
in miles from it. The locations for waldo and Carmen Snadiego with their
respective pictures are also rendered. Clicking the icon for either waldo 
or Carmen Sandiego makes an info window with the title, info and their
distance in miles from you. 

I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment. 

I discussed this assignment with Haris Iqbal on this assignment.
