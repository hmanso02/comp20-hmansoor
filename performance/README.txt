Assignment 4

1) To the best of my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly
   as specified in the assignment. 
   - I have rectified a mistake I made in assignment 2 which was not
     making image a variable. 
   - All the vehicles, logs and turtles move correctly across the screen. 
   - The frog responds to key presses. 
   - All colisions and drownings are correctly detected.
   - The scoring has been implemented as specified. 
   - The user is given 5 lives at the beginning of the game.
   - If a user loses all their lives, the user is notified by a confirm 
     box about this. Selecting OK on the box restarts the game. 

   I have added a few additional features as specified:
      a) Sound. The program has different sounds for frog moving, death,
         level up, and getting home safely. 
      b) Level Progrssion. Whenever the player takes 5 frogs safely 
         home, the level is increased and the user gains a 1000
         points. The user also has 20 seconds lesser for each new level. 
         After completing a level, a player is awarded 10 points for every
         second left. 
      c) Timing. The user has a specified amount of time to complete each
         level. The game starts at 200 s for level 1. For each new level, 
         the user has 20 seconds lesser.
      d) Snakes. In every game, a snake randomly appears on one of the 
         logs in the three log lanes. Touching the snake results in death.
         The snake is stationary. 

2) I discussed the assignment with Haris Iqbal.

3) I spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment.
