Comp20

1) Comp20 is a web programming course where we learn introduction level web
   development techniques. Topics include HTML, HTML5, JavaScript, JSON, 
   JQuery, AJAX, online databases, web applications and basic web security.

2) My favorite assignment was assignment 3. I liked it because it was in my
   opinion a very useful project with real world applications. I also improved
   my JavaScript and AJAX a lot because of that assignment. 

3) The assignment I am most proud of is Assignment 5. I am very proud of it 
   because I had a lot of trouble at the beginning of that project and I 
   figured out a lot of it through extensive testing. I am also proud of it 
   because it was the first time I deployed an application and could access it 
   from any computer!

4) I have developed a lot as a programmer because of this course. I am more 
   confident in my programming abilities and I understand websites and web
   applications a lot more than I did at the begining of this course. In 
   addition learning JavaScript with its C like syntax help me hone my C and 
   C++ skills as well.
